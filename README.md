# CS235 Spring 2021 Project
This web application is part of our study on menu colors and reaction time. We believe that higher contrast menus will result in faster reaction times, and want to determine what type(s) of high contrast colors will produce the fastest reaction time.

## Platform Requirements
Our web application can run on the following browsers:

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest

- IE latest

This is a non-exhaustive list and our application should work this older versions of these browsers as well.
